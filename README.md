# Oil_well_company
Machine Learning project about Oil well mining company
This time I work for the OilyGiant mining company. My task was to find the best place for a new well.
I had data on oil samples from three regions. The parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. I Built a model that  helped me to picked the region with the highest profit margin.
